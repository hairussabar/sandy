			  SANDY EXAMPLES
==================================================================

Most of these examples are equivalent to the tutorial pages on the
flashsandy website for the Sandy 3 series, mostly written by Max
Pellizzaro and MakC. Some contributed collada examples from Justin
Lawerance Mills, Guy Wheeler, Petit, and Ricardo Cabello. Get in
touch if you feel you should be credited.

Sandy's assets are available in sandy-hx-assets.tar.gz - on unix-y
systems, the command is

tar -zxvf sandy-hx-assets.tar.gz

or winzip on windows will unpack the assets folder.
